# WiFi Deauthentication Attack Simulation

## Description
This project demonstrates a controlled simulation of WiFi deauthentication attacks in a secure lab environment to understand wireless network vulnerabilities and defense mechanisms.The focus is on analyzing how deauthentication frames can disrupt communication between clients and access points in legacy WiFi networks.

This project is strictly for educational and ethical purposes, emphasizing security awareness, attack detection, and mitigation strategies rather than real-world exploitation.

## Objectives
- Understand WiFi authentication and deauthentication mechanisms
- Analyze the impact of deauthentication attacks on wireless clients
- Study vulnerabilities in unsecured or legacy WiFi protocols
- Learn mitigation techniques and defensive measures

## Key Features
- Simulation of WiFi deauthentication attacks in monitor mode
- Observation of client–access point disconnection behavior
- Analysis of network disruption and recovery patterns
- Discussion of mitigation strategies such as WPA3 and MFP (802.11w)
  
## Tools & Technologies
- Kali Linux
- Aircrack-ng suite (Airmon-ng, Aireplay-ng)
- IEEE 802.11 wireless standards
- Linux command-line tools
  
## Learning Outcomes
- Practical understanding of wireless security concepts
- Exposure to ethical hacking methodologies
- Awareness of legal and ethical boundaries in cybersecurity
- Improved knowledge of WiFi defense mechanisms
